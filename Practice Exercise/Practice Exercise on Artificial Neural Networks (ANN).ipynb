    "# Practice Exercise on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Practice Exercise on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). In this exercise, we will focus on a classification task where the goal is to predict customer churn. We will work with a dataset to build, train, and evaluate ANN model. This practice will allow you to apply your understanding of neural networks to achieve the best performance.\n",

    "### **Dataset Name:** Telco Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description:**  \n",
    "The dataset contains customer data from a telecommunications company and is used to predict customer churn.

    "- `OnlineSecurity`: Whether the customer has online security (Yes, No, No internet service).\n",
    "- `OnlineBackup`: Whether the customer has online backup (Yes, No, No internet service).\n",
    "- `DeviceProtection`: Whether the customer has device protection (Yes, No, No internet service).\n",
    "- `TechSupport`: Whether the customer has tech support (Yes, No, No internet service).\n",
    "- `StreamingTV`: Whether the customer has streaming TV service (Yes, No, No internet service).\n",
    "- `StreamingMovies`: Whether the customer has streaming movies service (Yes, No, No internet service).\n",
    "- `Contract`: The contract term of the customer (Month-to-month, One year, Two year).\n",
    "- `PaperlessBilling`: Whether the customer has paperless billing (Yes, No).\n",
    "- `PaymentMethod`: The payment method used by the customer (Electronic check, Mailed check, Bank transfer (automatic), Credit card (automatic)).\n",
    "- `MonthlyCharges`: The amount charged to the customer monthly.\n",
    "- `TotalCharges`: The total amount charged to the customer.\n",
    "- `Churn`: Whether the customer churned (Yes, No).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Target Variable:**\n",
    "- `Churn`: The variable that indicates whether a customer has churned or not."

    "* **Inspect the dataset**: The first step is to load the dataset and examine its structure. You will look at the first few rows to ensure it has been correctly loaded and check for basic formatting issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset structure**: Understand the structure of the dataset, including the number of rows, columns, and data types of each feature. This helps to identify categorical and numerical features and assess the need for data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summary statistics**: Generate summary statistics to better understand the distribution of numerical features. This includes measures like mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Check for missing values**: Identify any missing values in the dataset, as they can influence model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Distribution of features**: Plot the distributions of numerical features to identify skewness, outliers, or unusual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Categorical feature analysis**: For categorical variables, count the frequency of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlation matrix**: Generate a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Outlier detection**: Detect and visualize outliers, which can distort the training process. Outliers can be identified using box plots.\n",

    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handling missing values**: If there are any missing values identified during EDA, you must decide how to handle them. Common strategies include removing rows or columns with missing values, or imputing them using methods like the mean, median, or a constant value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoding categorical variables**: For machine learning models, categorical variables often need to be converted into numerical representations. Common techniques include:\n",
    "   - **One-hot encoding**: Converts categorical variables into a series of binary columns.\n",
    "   - **Label encoding**: Assigns a unique integer to each category.\n",
    "   \n",
    "* **Scaling and normalization**: Features often need to be scaled so that all of them contribute equally to the model. Two common techniques include:\n",
    "   - **Standardization (Z-score scaling)**: Centers the data around a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is suitable for algorithms that assume normally distributed data, such as neural networks.\n",
    "   - **Min-Max scaling (Normalization)**: Scales the data to a range (usually between 0 and 1). This technique is useful when the algorithm requires a bounded input range, such as in some neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Feature engineering**: In this step, new features can be created from the existing data to enhance the model’s predictive power. This may include combining features, applying mathematical transformations, or encoding domain-specific information.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handling imbalanced data** (if applicable): If the dataset has imbalanced classes, it may be necessary to apply techniques such as:\n",
    "   - **Oversampling** the minority class.\n",
    "   - **Undersampling** the majority class.\n",
