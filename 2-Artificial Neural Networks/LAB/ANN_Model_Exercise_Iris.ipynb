    "# Building an ANN with the Iris Dataset\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Introduction\n",
    "    Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. In this lab, you will construct a simple ANN to classify iris plants into one of three species based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. This exercise will help you understand the basics of neural networks, including their architecture, activation functions, and the backpropagation algorithm for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ## Dataset Reference\n",
    "    The Iris dataset was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It is widely used as a beginner's dataset for machine learning classification problems. You can access this dataset via the `sklearn.datasets` module.\n",
